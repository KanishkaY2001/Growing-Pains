# Growing Pains
**Growing Pains**, developed using Python, is a game which allows a player to simulate the full course of a human's life, through the various decisions, both difficult and cumbersome, that they make. Developed during my final year of HSC in 2019, this passion project includes almost 700 decisions to be made during the course of gameplay, beginning as a baby, and potentially living until you reach your deathbed, if you make the right decisions. What would you do if you had a second chance at life?
